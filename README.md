# 🔐 Crypto Utils

This folder contains various cryptographic functions and scripts that I implemented and used during CTF challenges and personal practice.  
It includes implementations and helpers for classical and modern cryptography.  

## 📂 Content
- `from bitarray import bitarray.py` → AES implementation / wrapper  
- `cesar.py` → Caesar cipher  
- `hill.py` → Hill cipher  
- `playfair.py` → Playfair cipher  
- `transposition.py` → Transposition cipher  
- `vigenere.py` → Vigenère cipher  
- `rsa_rabin_algamal.py` → RSA, Rabin, and ElGamal algorithms with digital signatures  
- `hmac_sha1.py` → HMAC with SHA-1 implementation  

## 🎯 Purpose
- Understand how different cryptographic algorithms work,  
- Practice implementing and breaking ciphers,  
- Use them in CTF challenges and study projects.
